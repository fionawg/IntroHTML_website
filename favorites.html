        <p>I love to play basketball. It's the first sport that I started to play and I started in elementary school. I was on the Brooklyn Tech team during my freshman year, but I haven't since then because of COVID-19 and an injury. I will always pick basketball over other sports.</p>
    
        <h2>Handball</h2>

        <p>The most recent sport that I picked up is handball. I started in 8th grade which isn't as long ago compared to basketball. However, I still love to play handball. I've met so many friends from handball and I'm always shocked when people tell me that they didn't know it was an actual sport. Most people just think I'm talking about European handball when I say handball. My season at Brooklyn Tech got cut off my freshman year. During my junior year, we got into the semi-finals.</p>
    
        <h2>Coding</h2>

        <p>I've been interested in computer science ever since middle school. My middle school had a "talent" class which was just an elective. I was placed in STEM Technology and I loved it. Now I enjoy coding and I want to major in computer science in college. Two summers ago, I did Girls Who Code which is where most of my HTML, CSS, and JavaScript knowledge comes from. Last summer I did a CTE internship for Computer Programming and I learned many things there too. I've also worked on a few personal projects before in Java and HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>
